                What is WHOIs?
                </p>
               <p className='font-dmsans text-lg max-w-xl text-justify'> WHOIS is the acronym for "who is" but is actually a protocol doing database queries regarding records of internet resources, such as IP addresses and domain names. The output of this protocol is in plain text. It was first described in a draft by the Internet Society, as its current version appears in RFC 3912. For those who wish a more direct functionality, most UNIX systems have a command-line utility that issues queries directlyâ€”the "whois" command.RWhois, or Referral WHOIS, enhances this protocol for further functionality.At Nest Nepal, we ensure seamless domain registration and management, leveraging tools like WHOIS to provide complete transparency.
